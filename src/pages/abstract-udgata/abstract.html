<b>Abstract</b>
<br>
The primary purpose of the sensors is to deliver data for monitoring and control.
However, approximately two decades ago researchers started to make use of the large
amounts of data being measured and stored in the industry by building predictive models
based on this data. Initially, these predictive models are called soft sensors are used in the
process industry only but slowly its relevance and importance is being felt in every [other
application domain involving sensors. This term “Soft Sensor” is a combination of the
words software, because the models are computer programs, and sensors, because the
models deliver information similar to their hardware counterparts. Soft sensing deals with
studying the interaction of the different parameters that can be used for calculating/
estimating new parameter that can not be measured directly. Soft sensors create windows
to a process where physical equivalents are unrealistic or even impossible. Sensor output
can be a control signal, advisory information for operators, predictions of quality of the
monitoring environment, information on process faults or outliers in data.
Intelligent sensors on the other hand are being viewed as smart sensors which are able to
take intelligent decisions based on the local information in stead of transmitting the data
to base station every time and thus saving a lot of crucial energy. Intelligent sensors are
able to correlate the data being observed and make necessary corrections before
<br>
presenting to user. Intelligent sensors can also correct the drift that normally happens due
to change in environmental condition, aging and beyond operating frequency.

Research Objectives
<br>
1. Making the soft sensor development as simple, automated and cheap as possible. This
includes providing the possibility to develop the soft sensors off-the- shelf with minimal
amount of required process knowledge as well as demand for parameter and model
selection;
<br>
2. Prolonging the lifetime of the soft sensors developed according to the concept by
means of their self-adaptation and effective exploitation of the provided feedback data;
<br>
3. Offering high flexibility, i.e. the algorithm can be manually tuned for the specific
modeling task if required;
<br>
4. Providing mechanisms for the incorporation of the potentially available process
knowledge. Despite the fact that the primary goal of this work is to minimize the demand
for process knowledge, very often a certain amount of this knowledge is available and
therefore it should be possible to effectively apply the available knowledge. Applying
such a concept should, on one hand, significantly simplify the soft sensor development
process and, on the other hand, minimize the requirement for periodical checking and
tuning of the models.
